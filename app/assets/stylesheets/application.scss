 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// This is a SCSS file. It's like CSS, but morer: https://sass-lang.com/guide

// Use @import to import Sass files.
// For css specific to just one resource, you'll probably want to just include it
// as a content_for :head in the haml file. @import it here if you want ALL views
// to have access.

// Bootstrap 4: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem
// Custom bootstrap variables must be set or imported *before* bootstrap.
// The available variables can be found here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss.
